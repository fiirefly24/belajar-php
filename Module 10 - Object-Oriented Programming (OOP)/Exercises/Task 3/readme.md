## ðŸ§© Task 3: Access Modifiers

Update your `User` class to:
- Make `$email` private  
- Add getter `getEmail()` â€” returns email only if not empty  
- Make `getInfo()` protected (only accessible via subclass)

Try calling `getInfo()` from outside and see what happens.

âœ… **Deliverable:** Paste updated class and explain what happens when you try accessing a protected method.
